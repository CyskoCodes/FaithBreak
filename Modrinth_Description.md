## 🔍 What Does FaithBreak Do?

FaithBreak is a unique Minecraft plugin that helps players take breaks during prayer times:

- 🌍 **Smart Location Detection**: The plugin automatically detects each player's location based on their IP address
- 🕰️ **Prayer Time Awareness**: Calculates accurate prayer times for the player's specific location
- ⏱️ **Timely Reminders**: Two minutes before prayer time, players are gently kicked from the server
- ⏳ **Break Duration**: Players can't rejoin for 12 minutes, giving them time for prayer or a short break
- 🌐 **Universal Respect**: Non-Muslim players are also encouraged to take regular breaks for well-being
- 🌐 **Multi-Language Magic**: Messages automatically appear in each player's Minecraft language!

The plugin works silently in the background with zero configuration needed. It uses geolocation services and prayer time APIs to ensure accuracy across different regions and timezones.

**💡 Server Owners**: Want to add more languages? Simply create `[language-code].yml` files in the `plugins/FaithBreak/languages` folder with your translations!

## 🙏 Why I Made This

I made this plugin to help my fellow **Muslim brothers and sisters** stay on track with their **prayer times**.  
Let’s be real — it’s easy to get completely lost in Minecraft and forget 😅  
This plugin gives a gentle nudge at the right moment 🕌⏰

Also, fun fact: this plugin is **automatically bundled** with every plugin I make.
